    | KUBEADM IS ALPHA, DO NOT USE IT FOR PRODUCTION CLUSTERS! |
    |                                                          |
    | But, please try it out! Give us feedback at:             |
    | https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues          |
    | and at-mention @kubernetes/sig-cluster-lifecycle         |
    \==========================================================/

Example usage:

    Create a two-machine cluster with one master (which controls the cluster),
    and one node (where workloads, like pods and containers run).

    On the first machine
    ====================
    master# kubeadm init master
    Your token is: <token>

    On the second machine
    =====================
    node# kubeadm join node --token=<token> <ip-of-master>
`,
	}
	// TODO also print the alpha warning when running any commands, as well as
	// in the help text.

	bootstrapParams := &BootstrapParams{}
	cmds.AddCommand(NewCmdInit(out, bootstrapParams))
	cmds.AddCommand(NewCmdJoin(out, bootstrapParams))
	cmds.AddCommand(NewCmdUser(out, bootstrapParams))
	cmds.AddCommand(NewCmdManual(out, bootstrapParams))

	return cmds
}
